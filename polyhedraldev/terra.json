We welcome Pull Requests implementing additional platforms!\n\n## Downloads:\n\n* Fabric: [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/terra)\n  / [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terra-world-generator)\n* Paper+ servers (Paper, Tuinity, Purpur,\n  etc): [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/85151/)\n\n## Building and Running Terra\n\nTo build, simply run `./gradlew build` (`gradlew.bat build` on Windows). This\nwill build all platforms, and produce JARs in `platforms/<platform>/build/libs`\n\n### Production JARs:\n\n* Bukkit: `Terra-<version>-shaded.jar`\n* Fabric: `Terra-<version>-shaded-mapped.jar`\n\n### Building a Specific Platform\n\nTo build a specific platform, run `gradlew :platforms:<platform>:build`.\n\nJARs are produced in `platforms/<platform>/build/libs`.\n\n### Running Minecraft in the IDE\n\nTo run Minecraft with Terra in the IDE (for testing) use the following tasks:\n\n* Bukkit\n    * `runServer` - Run the Paper test server with Terra installed.\n* Fabric\n    * `runClient` - Run a Minecraft Fabric client with Terra installed.\n    * `runServer` - Run a Minecraft Fabric server with Terra installed.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! If you want to see a feature in Terra, please, open\nan issue, or implement it yourself and submit a PR!\nJoin the discord [here](https://discord.gg/PXUEbbF) if you would like to talk\nmore about the project!\n\n## Licensing\n\nParts of Terra are licensed under either the MIT License or the GNU General\nPublic License, version 3.0.\n\n* Our API is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/PolyhedralDev/Terra/blob/master/LICENSE), to ensure that everyone\n  is able to freely use it however they want.\n* Our core addons are also licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/PolyhedralDev/Terra/blob/master/LICENSE), to ensure\n  that people can freely use code from them to learn and make their own addons,\n  without worrying about GPL infection.\n* Our platform-agnostic implementations and platform implementations are\n  licensed under\n  the [GNU General Public License, version 3.0](https://github.com/PolyhedralDev/Terra/blob/master/common/implementation/LICENSE),\n  to ensure that they remain free software wherever they are used.\n\nIf you're not sure which license a particular file is under, check:\n\n* The file's header\n* The LICENSE file in the closest parent folder of the file in question\n\n## Beta\n\nTerra is still in beta!

In the future TerraScript will probably support a way to hook into Parsii for math.\r\n* Added `state` function to TerraScript. `state`, as the name implies, allows manipulating NBT data on blocks. Use cases include setting text on signs, and mob spawner attributes.\r\n* Added `print` function to TerraScript. It will, as the name implies, print a string to the console.

What does this mean? It means Terra no longer depends on Bukkit, or Minecraft in general. This preview only includes a Bukkit version, but we are currently working on a Fabric implementation, and plan to do a Sponge implementation as well.\r\n* **TerraScript**\r\n    TerraScript brings you the most powerful structure system ever seen in a world generator. TerraScript is a full-blown scripting language designed for you to make structures with. This alpha comes bundled with procedurally generated Oak and Spruce trees, and a procedurally generated Village, all made with TerraScript. Don't worry, exporting structures is still super easy; our export command will generate basic scripts for you, so if you just want a single-part structure, it's basically the same process as earlier versions. TerraScript simply adds on to the structure system, allowing you to create anything you want, with ease. We also have a conversion utility for converting the legacy `.tstructure` format to TerraScript.\r\n* **Dependency on Gaea Removed**\r\n    Gaea existed as a way for Terra and BetterEnd to share code. Now that BetterEnd has reached its EOL, Gaea is no longer needed. As such, it has been merged into Terra. You will not need Gaea installed to run future versions of Terra.",
