  "description": "# LuckPermsPlaceholders (Allay)\n\nOptional plugin which provides LuckPerms placeholders for Allay's PlaceholderAPI\n\n## Install\n\n- Download .jar file from [release](https://github.com/AllayMC/LuckPermsPlaceholders/releases)\n- Put it into `plugins` folder\n- Restart the server, enjoy!\n\n## Available Placeholders\n\nFor placeholders with an **argument**, the argument must be included at the end of the placeholder separated by an underscore (`_`).\n\nFor example, the `{luckperms|meta}` placeholder requires a `<meta key>` argument. Assuming the meta key is e.g. *home*, the full placeholder would be `{luckperms|meta_home}`.\n\n| Placeholder                                      | Argument                     | Description                                                                                                                                      |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `{luckperms\\|prefix}`                            |                              | Returns the player's prefix                                                                                                                      |\n| `{luckperms\\|suffix}`                            |                              | Returns the players suffix                                                                                                                       |\n| `{luckperms\\|meta}`                              | `<meta key>`                 | Returns a single value for the given meta key                                                                                                    |\n| `{luckperms\\|meta_all}`                          | `<meta key>`                 | Returns all assigned values for the given meta key                                                                                               |\n| `{luckperms\\|prefix_element}`                    | `<element>`                  | Returns a prefix element using the given \"meta stack\" element definition.
